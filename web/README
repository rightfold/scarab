The /web directory contains the entry points of the application. They are
directly requested by the client. To write a new entry point, create a file
in this directory with the following format:

    <?php
    require_once __DIR__ . '/bootstrap.php';
    \Scarab\Main::<handle>();

See the file /web/bootstrap.php for more information.
